#+TODO: TODO | DONE | WONTFIX

* infoman

tried to browse sql.el docstrings in two renamed *Help* buffers, but quickly lost

infoman-help.el should render docstring using standard help functions
in a temporary *Help*-like buffer, then post-process its output
by changing known links to Info links

infoman-man.el should use synchronous man.el (to be implemented in some bug#)

* vc-annotate

vc-annotate should align two windows by setting window-start (in addition to window-point)
like in vi, it was shame to hear this from a vi user

* xref

<H-M-right> M-. on man

check if eglot uses xref M-.

* display-buffer actions

need new display action (direction . right)
with optional parameter (create-window . t)
like windmove-create-window

TRY to use it for 'C-z d' (vc-dir-in-project-root)
