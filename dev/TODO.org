* diff-goto-line

Subject: bug#36526: Open diff at current location (feature request with suggested code)
https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/efu71g/announce_diffatpoint_now_available_in_melpa/

Implementations:
1. https://gitlab.com/ideasman42/emacs-diff-at-point
2. (qv "~/.emacs.d/elpa/diff-hl-20200701.2141/diff-hl.el"
    "(defun diff-hl-diff-skip-to (line)")
3. https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-02/msg01066.html

Issues:
1. diff-goto-line doesn't work with 'C-x v D'
2. 'C-c C-d' (log-edit-show-diff) leaves point at end, should leave at beginning
3. should be customizable?

* inhibit-messages

[[file:test.el][./test.el]]

* debbugs

bug#12986: Pressing backspace during isearch exits case-sensitive and word modes

bug#42052: 28.0.50; tab-bar-mode should be frame-local

bug#43405: Tool bar item doesn't align to the right edge

bug#43830: keyboard layout handling incompatible with rest of the OS

bug#44001: vc-print-log-setup-buttons leaves point at eob

* isearch bug

(add-hook 'isearch-mode-end-hook
              (message "! isearch-mode-end-hook %S %S" last-input-event (car search-ring))

* infoman

tried to browse sql.el docstrings in two renamed *Help* buffers, but quickly lost

infoman-help.el should render docstring using standard help functions
in a temporary *Help*-like buffer, then post-process its output
by changing known links to Info links

infoman-man.el should use synchronous man.el (to be implemented in some bug#)

* vc-annotate

vc-annotate should align two windows by setting window-start (in addition to window-point)
like in vi, it was shame to hear this from a vi user

* xref

<H-M-right> M-. on man

check if eglot uses xref M-.

* display-buffer actions

need new display action (direction . right)
with optional parameter (create-window . t)
like windmove-create-window

TRY to use it for 'C-z d' (vc-dir-in-project-root)
