* print-integers-as-characters

(let ((print-integers-as-characters t))
  (pp '(("'A" . [?Á])
        ("'E" . [?É])
        ("'I" . [?Í])
        ("'O" . [?Ó])
        ("'U" . [?Ú])
        ("'Y" . [?Ý]))
      (current-buffer)))

(let ((print-integers-as-characters t))
  (format "%S" [?Á]))

but what if someone will want to print integers not in 10-base,
but as binary, octal, hex?

maybe better to provide ‘integer-output-format’ like ‘float-output-format’
with values ‘character’, ‘binary’, ‘octal’, ‘hex’

* vc-annotate

vc-annotate should align two windows by setting window-start (in addition to window-point)
like in vi, it was shame to hear this from a vi user

* xref

<H-M-right> M-. on man

check if eglot uses xref M-.

* display-buffer actions

need new display action (direction . right)
with optional parameter (create-window . t)
like windmove-create-window

TRY to use it for 'C-z d' (vc-dir-in-project-root)
