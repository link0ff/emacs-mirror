See https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=12492#23
There was also a discussion on emacs-devel quite a bit later
and f302475471df0553b3ee442112981f9b146e0b55

TODO: C-x v V should deduce all changed files

** Example

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
(with-temp-buffer
  (vc-call-backend
   (vc-responsible-backend default-directory) 'dir-status-files default-directory nil
   (lambda (entries &optional more-to-come)
     (message "! %S" entries))))
#+end_src
